**Stack: Angular, TypeScript**

**ArtQuiz** is a game with two modes of play: guess an artist or guess a painting. After the end of the game round the results page becomes available to you. The game progress is saved in the LocalStorage of the browser. 

There is also a settings page where you can turn on/off the time game, change the volume of sounds or clear your game progress.

Gallery page is created using ngx-pagination. Here you can explore masterpieces sorting them in the way you need. 

The application is adaptive for screens from 1920px to 320px.
